# Grab Tracks #

Grab Tracks is a tool built using the [Backbone Boilerplate](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate) that searches [http://www.soundcloud.com](SoundCloud) for downloadable tracks. The idea was to make looking for tracks to download on SoundCloud a little bit more enjoyable for the digital-dj type.
